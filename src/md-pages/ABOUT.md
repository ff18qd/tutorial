## About This Tutorial
This tutorial will give you a brief overview of how [Wobbly](https://bananananaba.com/Wobbly.html) volunteers are using Styled Components and Atomic Design in their process. Some experience with React is recommended, but there's opportunity for developers of all skill levels to get involved.

Rather than working in a cloud environment you'll be working in your local environment since that's how you'll likely be working as a contributor to this project. While you are encouraged to explore and take a look at how this tutorial project has been set up, understanding exactly how everything works is by no means a requirement to contribute.

### Workspace
The main directory you'll be working in can be found at `/workspace` within the project's `/src` directory. It's pretty empty right now, apart from a single component we've already set up for you. Soon enough you'll be adding and creating your own components within this directory.

Within your workspace you'll find a React Component file name `MyComponent.js`. This will be the main file you'll be editing and it's necessary for your changes to be shown within the "My Component" UI ([see below](#MyComponent)) where you'll see your changes rendering out automagically when you save a file. For this reason, we recommend not changing it's name and just following along for now.
