3. After successfully installed yarn, there is one more step to check. If you are a Windows user, go to Edit system environment variables. Click on Environment Variable button and check the Path. Make sure the path to yarn/bin is the same as your laptop/PC. The default setting of path after installation may not be the same as on your system. If it is not the same, use Edit to change it according to your system's setting.
